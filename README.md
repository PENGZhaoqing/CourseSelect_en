# CourseSelect(en) 

## Introduction

This sample system is an extended english version of CourseSelect [Original Version](https://github.com/PENGZhaoqing/CourseSelect), which is developed for the UCAS master course (Senior Software Engineering). Aiming to help beginners to learn RoR (Ruby on Rails).
Based on this, beginners can add more function:

* Deal with course conflict and control the student number
* Count credit points, degree course, etc.
* Add the function of opening and closing the selective courses system.
* Customize administrator backstage
* Authorized login based on OAuth
* Data input in Excel format
* Bind userâ€™s mailbox (to achieve the function of register activation,forgot password, etc.)
* Search and retrieval within the site (such as searching courses 
* according to the classification)

## Another Motivation 

This app extends the original CourseSelect with OAuth Interaction, which aimed to demonstrate the interaction beetween [UcasPortal](https://github.com/PENGZhaoqing/UcasPortal) and other web application with OAuth 2.0 protocol. 

[UcasPortal](https://github.com/PENGZhaoqing/UcasPortal) is a campus portals information system developed to provide as unified access entrance for the faculties, students and campus application developers. Because of the popularity of utilizing  OAuth 2.0, UcasPortal can communicate with pervasive web applications, which were supported by various languages such as python, php, ruby and so on.

And This app is a rails sample web app written by ruby, which could show how the UcasPortal works with ruby apps
